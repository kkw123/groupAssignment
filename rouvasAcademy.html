<h1>Chord Organ Rouvas Academy of Singing

I have been in the music industry in Sydney for over 30 years in the capacity of singing teacher, stage performer, singer and musician. 
<br>
<br>
My daughter Diana Rouvas was a finalist in the 2012 “The Voice” television show and she is a testament to what can be achieved with correct vocal training. 
<br>
<br>
Allow me to show you her technique and give yourself the opportunity to excel as a vocalist.

Skype lessons also available
