<h2>Mission</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            The main goal for the website is to increase concert ticket sales
            among families and people with music interests aged 18-60
            by 30% within 8 months from the launch of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will be achieved by posting updates and promotions on the website.
            Links to artist biographies will also be provided to let visitors know
            more about the performing artists, increasing their interest.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The secondary goal for the website is to increase recruitment rate
            of people aged 18 - 60 with music interest by 15% within 4 months
            from the launch of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            It will attract them by showcasing
            interesting testimonials from existing members.
        </p>
    </li>

    <p>
        <b>Other goals include:</b>
    </p>
    <li>
        <p>
            To increase the number of members who participate in our activities
            by 20% within 4 months of the launch of the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            This will be achieved
            by providing information about the activities with easy forms to allow members
            to sign up.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            To increase the number of concerts held for performers by 10% within 1 year
            of the launch.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website will provide a list of services and benefits
            that we offer for performers. It will also feature successful concerts
            that were organised before.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            To increase the number of performers who agree to photo-shoots and promotions
            by 50% per month within 1 year of the launch.
        </p>
        <p>
            The website will list the
            benefits for performers, as well as testimonials from previous performers.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p>
            To measure the increase in concert ticket sales, the total revenue collected
            per concert will be tabulated and checked every 2 months. These numbers will
            give us accurate data about how successful the sales are.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            To measure the increase in recruitment rate, the number of new members
            will be checked every month. Additionally, they will be asked what
            encouraged them to join, which would allow us to determine if the website
            was the main cause.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            To measure the amount of member participation, the number of members
            for each activity will be tracked. Additionally, their names will
            be collected to determine if the same group of members is very active,
            or if it is a mix of people. A mix of people would be preferable.
        </p>
    </li><li>
        <p>
            The number of concerts held for performers will be recorded and checked
            every 2 months. We will also check if we are getting new performers
            to engage us for concerts, or if it the same few performers. A rotation
            of performers would be better as it would be more attractive to
            concert-goers to have various styles of concerts to attend.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The number and names of performers who agree to photo-shoots will
            be tracked every 3 months. They will be asked to write brief testimonials
            to encourage other performers to cooperate.
        </p>
    </li>
</ol>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>
    The main target audiences of the website are music lovers aged 18-60, and families
    who enjoy doing family activities together.
</p>
<p>
    To appeal to music lovers, a list of music categories will be shown on the
    website, with each category containing performers who have engaged us previously.
    This group tends to respond well to their own individual music tastes, so a
    broad range of musical categories should be used. Links to YouTube videos
    of sample music or inline music playback would also help to attract this group.
</p>
<p>
    To appeal to families, our children-friendly policy will be highlighted, and
    images of families enjoying our events will be shown. Events will also be listed
    as family-friendly to encourage families to join, and let them know exactly which
    events are appropriate for them and their children.
