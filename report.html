    <h2>Testing Details</h2>

    <h2>PMI</h2>
    <ul>
    	<li>
    		<p><strong>Pluses: </strong> We were able to discuss and come to agreements of how to do the website easily. The sharing of work and updating of the GitHub repo was done in a consistent manner that made it easy to work when we weren't in the same room. This meant that we could spend meeting times discussing important things.</p>
    <p><strong>Minuses: </strong> Sometimes work could be left undone or delayed, and we would have to check with each other who was going to do it, so our communication could have been improved. Also, we ran into git conflicts when some of us didn't pull regularly or when we worked on the same file at the same time.</p>
    <p><strong>Interesting: </strong> It was fun to explore and collaborate on a website with other people.</p>
